    "\n",
    "Sensors are noisy. The world is full of data and events that we want to measure and track, but we cannot rely on sensors to give us perfect information. The GPS in my car reports altitude. Each time I pass the same point in the road it reports a slightly different altitude. My kitchen scale gives me different readings if I weigh the same object twice.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple cases the solution is obvious. If my scale gives slightly different readings I can just take a few readings and average them. Or I can replace it with a more accurate scale. But what do we do when the sensor is very noisy, or the environment makes data collection difficult? We may be trying to track the movement of a low flying aircraft. We may want to create an autopilot for a drone, or ensure that our farm tractor seeded the entire field. I work on computer vision, and I need to track moving objects in images, and the computer vision algorithms create very noisy and unreliable results. \n",
    "\n",
    "This book teaches you how to solve these sorts of filtering problems. I use many different algorithms, but they are all based on *Bayesian probability*. In simple terms Bayesian probability determines what is likely to be true based on past information. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I asked you the heading of my car at this moment you would have no idea. You'd proffer a number between 1$^\\circ$ and 360$^\\circ$ degrees, and have a 1 in 360 chance of being right. Now suppose I told you that 2 seconds ago its heading was 243$^\\circ$. In 2 seconds my car could not turn very far so you could make a far more accurate prediction. You are using past information to more accurately infer information about the present or future. \n",
    "\n",
    "The world is also noisy. That prediction helps you make a better estimate, but it also subject to noise. I may have just braked for a dog or swerved around a pothole. Strong winds and ice on the road  are external influences on the path of my car. In control literature we call this *noise* though you may not think of it that way. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is more to Bayesian probability, but you have the main idea. Knowledge is uncertain, and we alter our beliefs based on the strength of the evidence. Kalman and Bayesian filters blend our noisy and limited knowledge of how a system behaves with the noisy and limited sensor readings to produce the best possible estimate of the state of the system. Our principle is to never discard information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we are tracking an object and a sensor reports that it suddenly changed direction. Did it really turn, or is the data noisy? It depends. If this is a jet fighter we'd be very inclined to believe the report of a sudden maneuver. If it is a freight train on a straight track we would discount it. We'd further modify our belief depending on how accurate the sensor is. Our beliefs depend on the past and on our knowledge of the system we are tracking and on the characteristics of the sensors. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Kalman filter was invented by Rudolf Emil Kálmán to solve this sort of problem in a mathematically optimal way. Its first use was on the Apollo missions to the moon, and since then it has been used in an enormous variety of domains. There are Kalman filters in aircraft, on submarines, and on cruise missiles. Wall street uses them to track the market. They are used in robots, in IoT (Internet of Things) sensors, and in laboratory instruments. Chemical plants use them to control and monitor reactions. They are used to perform medical imaging and to remove noise from cardiac signals. If it involves a sensor and/or time-series data, a Kalman filter or a close relative to the Kalman filter is usually involved."

    "## Motivation for this Book\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm a software engineer that spent almost two decades in aerospace, and so I have always been 'bumping elbows' with the Kalman filter, but never implemented one. They've always had a fearsome reputation for difficulty. The theory is beautiful, but quite difficult to learn if you are not already well trained in topics such as signal processing, control theory, probability and statistics, and guidance and control theory. As I moved into solving tracking problems with computer vision the need to implement them myself became urgent. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are excellent textbooks in the field, such as Grewal and Andrew's *Kalman Filtering*. But sitting down and trying to read many of these books is a dismal and trying experience if you do not have the necessary background. Typically the first few chapters fly through several years of undergraduate math, blithely referring you to textbooks on Itō calculus, and presenting an entire semester's worth of statistics in a few brief paragraphs. They are textbooks for an upper undergraduate  or graduate level course, and an invaluable reference to researchers and professionals, but the going is truly difficult for the more casual reader. Notation is introduced without explanation, different texts use different words and variable names for the same concept, and the books are almost devoid of examples or worked problems. I often found myself able to parse the words and comprehend the mathematics of a definition, but had no idea as to what real world phenomena these words and math were attempting to describe. \"But what does that *mean?*\" was my repeated thought. Here are typical examples which once puzzled me:\n",

    "\n",
    "我是一名软件工程师，在航空领域工作了近二十年，所以我一直用卡尔曼滤波器“碰撞弯头”，但从未实现过。他们一直有一个难以置信的声誉。这个理论很漂亮，但是如果你在信号处理，控制理论，概率和统计学以及指导和控制理论等方面还没有很好的训练，那么这个理论很难学。当我开始解决跟踪计算机视觉问题时，我自己实现它们的需求变得紧迫。\n",
    "\n",
    "这个领域有很好的教科书，比如Grewal和Andrew的Kalman Filtering *。但如果你没有必要的背景知识，坐下来阅读许多这些书是一种令人沮丧和尝试的经历。通常前几章是通过几年的本科数学课程，轻松地向您介绍伊藤计算方面的教科书，并在短短几段中介绍整个学期的统计数据。它们是高年级本科或研究生水平课程的教科书，对研究人员和专业人士来说是非常宝贵的参考资料，但对于更休闲的读者来说，这确实很困难。注释的引入没有解释，不同的文本对同一概念使用不同的词语和变量名称，而书籍几乎没有例子或工作问题。我经常发现自己能够解析这些词并理解一个定义的数学，但不知道这些词和数学试图描述的现实世界现象。 “但那是什么意思？”是我重复的想法。以下是一些令我感到困惑的典型例子：\n",

    "However, as I began to finally understand the Kalman filter I realized the underlying concepts are quite straightforward. If you know a few simple probability rules, and have some intuition about how we fuse uncertain knowledge, the concepts of the Kalman filter are accessible. Kalman filters have a reputation for difficulty, but shorn of much of the formal terminology the beauty of the subject and of their math became clear to me, and I fell in love with the topic. \n",
    "\n",
    "As I began to understand the math and theory more difficulties appeared. A book or paper will make some statement of fact and presents a graph as proof.  Unfortunately, why the statement is true is not clear to me, or I cannot reproduce the plot. Or maybe I wonder \"is this true if R=0?\"  Or the author provides pseudocode at such a high level that the implementation is not obvious. Some books offer Matlab code, but I do not have a license to that expensive package. Finally, many books end each chapter with many useful exercises. Exercises which you need to understand if you want to implement Kalman filters for yourself, but exercises with no answers. If you are using the book in a classroom, perhaps this is okay, but it is terrible for the independent reader. I loathe that an author withholds information from me, presumably to avoid 'cheating' by the student in the classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this impedes learning. I want to track an image on a screen, or write some code for my Arduino project. I want to know how the plots in the book are made, and to choose different parameters than the author chose. I want to run simulations. I want to inject more noise into the signal and see how a filter performs. There are thousands of opportunities for using Kalman filters in everyday code, and yet this fairly straightforward topic is the provenance of rocket scientists and academics.\n",
    "\n",
    "I wrote this book to address all of those needs. This is not the sole book for you if you design military radars. Go get a Masters or PhD at a great STEM school, because you'll need it. This book is for the hobbyist, the curious, and the working engineer that needs to filter or smooth data. If you are a hobbyist this book should provide everything you need. If you are serious about Kalman filters you'll need more. My intention is to introduce enough of the concepts and mathematics to make the textbooks and papers approachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is interactive. While you can read it online as static content, I urge you to use it as intended. It is written using Jupyter Notebook. This allows me to combine text, math, Python, and Python output in one place. Every plot, every piece of data in this book is generated from Python inside the notebook. Want to double the value of a parameter? Just change the parameter's value, and press CTRL-ENTER. A new plot or printed output will appear. \n",
    "\n",
    "This book has exercises, but it also has the answers. I trust you. If you just need an answer, go ahead and read the answer. If you want to internalize this knowledge, try to implement the exercise before you read the answer. Since the book is interactive, you enter and run your solution inside the book - you don't have to move to a different environment, or deal with importing a bunch of stuff before starting.\n",
    "\n",
    "This book is free. I've spent several thousand dollars on Kalman filtering books. I cannot believe they are within the reach of someone in a depressed economy or a financially struggling student. I have gained so much from free software like Python, and free books like those from Allen B. Downey  [1]. It's time to repay that. So, the book is free, it is hosted on free servers at GitHub, and it uses only free and open software such as IPython and MathJax."

If you want to run code examples, and especially if you want to see animated plots, you will need to run the code cells. I cannot teach you everything about Jupyter Notebooks. However, a few things trip readers up. You can go to http://jupyter.org/ for detailed documentation.\n",

This does not just set up formatting, which you might not care about, but it also loads some necessary modules and makes some global settings regarding plotting and printing. So, always run this cell unless you are just passively reading. The import from `__future__` helps Python 2.7 work like Python 3.X. Division of integers will return a `float` (`3/10 == 0.3`) instead of an `int` (`3/10 == 0`), and printing requires parens: `print(3)`, not `print 3`. The line\n",

    "causes plots to be displayed inside the notebook. Matplotlib is a plotting package which is described below. For reasons I don't understand the default behavior of Jupyter Notebooks is to generate plots in an external window. \n",
    "\n",
    "The percent sign in `%matplotlib` is used for IPython *magic* - these are commands to the kernel to do things that are not part of the Python language. There are many useful magic commands, and you can read about them here: http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/magics.html \n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code inside a cell is easy. Click on it so that it has focus (a box will be drawn around it), and then press CTRL-Enter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second, cells must be run in order. I break problems up over several cells; if you try to just skip down and run the tenth code cell it almost certainly won't work. If you haven't run anything yet just choose *Run All Above* from the **Cell** menu item. That's the easiest way to ensure everything has been run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once cells are run you can often jump around and rerun cells in different orders, but not always. I'm trying to fix this, but there is a tradeoff. I'll define a variable in cell 10 (say), and then run code that modifies that variable in cells 11 and 12. If you go back and run cell 11 again the variable will have the value that was set in cell 12, and the code expects the value that was set in cell 10. So, occasionally you'll get weird results if you run cells out of order. My advise is to backtrack a bit, and run cells in order again to get back to a proper state. It's annoying, but the interactive aspect of Jupyter notebooks more than makes up for it. Better yet, submit an issue on GitHub so I know about the problem and fix it!\n",

    "Finally, some readers have reported problems with the animated plotting features in some browsers. I have not been able to reproduce this. In parts of the book I use the `%matplotlib notebook` magic, which enables interactive plotting. If these plots are not working for you, try changing this to read `%matplotlib inline`. You will lose the animated plotting, but it seems to work on all platforms and browsers."

    "在单元内运行代码很容易。点击它使它具有焦点（一个框将围绕它），然后按下CTRL-Enter。\n",

    "一旦cell运行，您可以跳转并以不同顺序重新运行cell，但并非总是如此。我试图解决这个问题，但是有一个权衡。我将在单元格10中定义一个变量（比如说），然后在单元格11和12中运行修改该变量的代码。如果返回并再次运行单元格11，变量将具有在单元格12中设置的值，并且代码需要单元10中设置的值。因此，如果您按顺序运行单元格，偶尔会得到奇怪的结果。我的建议是回溯一下，然后再运行单元以恢复到正确的状态。这很烦人，但Jupyter笔记本电脑的交互性方面不止弥补它。更好的是，在GitHub上提交一个问题，让我知道这个问题并修复它！\n",

I try to avoid this because then I always face the issue of code in the directory becoming out of sync with the code in the book.

    "Most Kalman filtering and other engineering texts are written by mathematicians or academics. When there is software (rarely), it is not production quality. Take Paul Zarchan's book *Fundamentals of Kalman Filtering* as an example. This is a fantastic book which belongs in your library, and is one of the few books that provides full source for every example and chart. But the code is Fortran without any subroutines beyond calls to functions like `MATMUL`. Kalman filters are re-implemented throughout the book. The same listing mixes simulation with filtering code, making it hard to distinguish them. Some chapters implement the same filter in subtly different ways, and uses bold text to highlight the few lines that changed. If Runge Kutta is needed it is embedded in the code, without comments. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's a better way. If I want to perform Runge Kutta I call `ode45`, I do not embed an Runge Kutta implementation in my code. I don't want to implement Runge Kutta multiple times and debug it several times. if I do find a bug, I can fix it once and be assured that it now works across all my different projects. And, it is readable. It is rare that I care about the implementation of Runge Kutta.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a textbook on Kalman filtering, and you can argue that we *do* care about the implementation of Kalman filters. That is true, but the code that performs the filtering uses about 10 lines of code. The code to implement the math is fairly trivial. Most of the work that Kalman filter requires is the design of the matrices that get fed into the math engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possible downside is that the equations that perform the filtering are hidden behind functions, which we could argue is a loss in a pedagogical text. I argue the converse. I want you to learn how to use Kalman filters in the real world, for real projects, and you shouldn't be cutting and pasting established algorithms all over the place.\n",
    "\n",
    "I use Python classes. I mostly use classes as a way to organize the data that the filters require, not to implement object oriented (OO) features such as inheritence. For example, the `KalmanFilter` class stores matrices and vectors called `x`, `P`, `R`, `Q`, `S`, `y`, `K`. I've seen procedural libraries for Kalman filters, and they require the programmer to maintain all of those matrices. This perhaps isn't so bad for a toy program, but program a bank of Kalman filters and you will not enjoy having to manage all of those matrices and other associated data. I have derived from these classes occasionally in my own work, and find it handy, but I don't want to force OO on people as I know many do not like it."
